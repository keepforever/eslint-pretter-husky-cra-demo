## About

These unformatted files do not get reviewed by **Prettier** or **Eslint** because they fall outside of the src directory.

## Why

These files are here so you can copy/paste them into the /comps folder, then run the following to see husky in action:
```sh
git add .
```

```sh
git commit -m "whatever message"
```
